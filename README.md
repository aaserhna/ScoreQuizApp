> Code files for my "Sports Quiz" Android app; the Final project of the Udacity's Android Beginner course.


## Introduction
**Sports Quiz App** as the name implies is an app featuring ten (10) questions on Sports. Each question takes one of three formats:
- Single Choice: the question has three options (_possible answers_) from which the user selects an answer. Each option is displayed using a radio button. Only one of the three options is the correct answer to the question.
- Multiple Choice: the question has three options from which the user selects two. Each option is displayed using a checkbox. Only two of the three options make a correct answer ot the question.
- Typed Text: here, the user has to type in the answer in a text field.

## Scoring
The user is to attempt all questions. A correct answer attracts one point. Ten questions implies a maximum of 10 points is up for grabs.
After attempting the questions, the user taps on the **SUBMIT** button to get his/her quiz score which is displayed onscreen via a **Toast** message. The message displayed varies depending on the user's score thus:
- Score of 0: for example...
``` Unbelievable! You scored 0 out of 10 ```
- Score from 1 and 4: for example...
``` Nice try! You scored 3 out of 10 ```
- Score from 5 to 7: for example...
 ``` Good job! You scored 5 out of 10 ```
- Score from 8 to 9: for example...
 ``` Excellent! You scored 8 out of 10 ```
- Score of 10: for example...
 ``` Awesome! You scored 10 out of 10 ```
